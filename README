s6-portable-utils - tiny general Unix utilities
-----------------------------------------------

s6-portable-utils is a set of tiny general Unix utilities,
some performing well-known tasks such as cut and grep,
others being nonstandard but useful in a variety of
scripting situations; they have been optimized for simplicity
and small size. They were designed for embedded systems and
other constrained environments, but they work everywhere.
